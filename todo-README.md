Well, first of all... the surge deployment errors out. : /

SyntaxError: Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0

I have no idea where to even start debugging this.


## Things to learn

- General architecture
- Discuss components with 3rd party JavaScript - should I make the fit-text component an addon?
- Ember window size aware / ember-resize - can services not be injected into services?
- Build a context aware image component that can search for appropriate sources
- Also, don't load this image until it is almost in view.
- Learn more about when to worry about fastboot and when to ignore it. We just want the SEO value - and don't ever expect anyone to visit our site without JavaScript
- Learn about environments. How to build the site with Mirage, but then in production use the real endpoints
- How to only show a component in 'development' and not 'production'
-
